# Getting started with ArcGIS Pro:

__GIS:__ (Geographic Information System) An integrated collection of computer software and data used to view and manage information about geographic places, analyze spatial relationships, and model spatial processes. (from [*A to Z GIS*](http://libraries.colorado.edu/record=b4498015~S3))

__Visit:__
- [GIS Library guide](https://libguides.colorado.edu/gis)
- [Geospatial Data Guide](https://libguides.colorado.edu/geospatialdata)
- [Colorado GeoLibrary](https://geo.colorado.edu)

__Documentation:__
- Esri's help docs are excellent and are available here: [ArcGIS Pro help](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/main/welcome-to-the-arcgis-pro-app-help.htm){:target="_blank"}.

### Starting a project  

1. Open up Pro, sign in, and create a blank project (or start without a template)  

    ![Setting up your project][ARCPRO1]  

2. Name your project and tell Pro where to save it. *Note:* If you already have created a folder for your project, you can unclick the Create new folder option.  

    ![Name your project][ARCPRO2]

    __Connect a GeoDataBase__

3. From the Insert tab add data folders or connect geodatabases where your data lives:  

    ![Connect your folders][ARCPRO3]

    __Add a map__

4. From the Insert tab, click New Map to add a map:  

    ![Insert a map][ARCPRO4]

### The ArcGIS Pro Desktop Interface:
![The ArcGIS interface][ARCPRO5]  

__Interface Tips:__
- The interface should look vaguely familiar--it is essentially a copy of Microsoft Office!
- Tabs across the top are dynamic; some only appear when needed.
- You may use the Map tab most often, but you'll also use Analysis and Insert a lot.
- Note the tabs across the far right of the Window. You'll often find useful tools like the Catalog and Toolbox menu here, and these can be pinned for quick access.
